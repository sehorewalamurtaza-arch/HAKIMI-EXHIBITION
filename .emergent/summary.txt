<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a barebones FastAPI/React/MongoDB application into a professionally branded, functional MVP for the Badshah - Hakimi Exhibition Sales Platform. Development proceeded through several pivots based on user feedback: initial implementation of enterprise features, simplification to an elegant design, migration from email-based to username-based authentication for POS efficiency, fixing critical frontend loading issues, and finally, restoring the authentic Hakimi branding and full feature set by leveraging content crawled from a user-provided GitHub repository. A key technical challenge was fixing a failed bcrypt implementation by switching to a stable SHA-256 based JWT authentication mechanism. In the final phase, core systems like Categories, Products, Expense Management (with quick buttons), and a fully functional Point of Sale (POS) were built out with sample data, making the app immediately ready to use. The current conversation halted just as the user requested a final check of the implemented POS logic against the original GitHub source code.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to deliver a professional, high-tech, and extremely user-friendly Exhibition Sales Platform (Badshah - Hakimi). The requirements evolved from general enterprise features to specific operational needs:
1.  **Authentication:** Simple username/password login for staff access (Admin, Cashier, Inventory roles), replacing complex email login. Admin maintains control over user creation.
2.  **Branding & Design:** Must feature an elegant, minimalist UI using premium typography (Inter font). Crucially, the system must restore and integrate the original Hakimi branding, including the golden circular logo, Badshah - Hakimi Exhibition Sales Platform title, and amber/orange gradient theme.
3.  **Functionality:** Restore the complete structure from the original GitHub source, including Dashboard, Categories, Products, Exhibitions, Leads, and Reports.
4.  **Operational Readiness:** The system must be immediately ready to use with sample data.
    *   **Expense Manager:** Must allow daily input and feature easy amount editable buttons (25-500 AED) for common costs (Travel, Hotel, Staff Salary).
    *   **Point of Sale (POS):** Must be easy to use, supporting product grids, cart management, real-time calculation, and 5% tax application, formatted in AED/QAR.
</product_requirements>
<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack:** FastAPI (Backend), React (Frontend), MongoDB (Database).
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, SHA-256 for password hashing (replacing problematic bcrypt setup).
- **Frontend Styling:** Tailwind CSS and modern React components (shadcn/ui), emphasizing elegance (Inter font).
- **API:** All backend routes are prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress compatibility.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack structure:



- ****: The core FastAPI application. It handles database connection via , implements the JWT/SHA-256 authentication system using usernames, and exposes API endpoints (prefixed with ) for user management, dashboard analytics, and exhibition data. This file was critically updated to resolve password hashing issues and switch from email to username login.
- ****: The main React file. It defines the application context (), manages authentication state, and sets up routing for the different application views (Login, Dashboard, Categories, etc.). It was extensively modified to restore the complex multi-component structure from the original repository and fix a major rendering/loading issue.
- ****: Contains global and utility styles. Updated to apply the elegant Inter font, minimalist design, and the authentic Hakimi amber/orange color theme/gradients.
- ****: Houses the complex, ready-to-use Point of Sale interface, including product display, cart logic, tax calculation, and currency handling (AED).
- ****: Contains the logic for the daily expense logging system, featuring quick-select buttons for fast input of common expense amounts (e.g., 50 AED).
</code_architecture>
<pending_tasks>
- Recheck and validate the implemented Point of Sale (POS) system functionality against the original logic contained in the external GitHub repository () to ensure all user's previous changes were incorporated.
</pending_tasks>
<current_work>
The system is the Badshah - Hakimi Exhibition Sales Platform, fully implemented and operational based on the user's iterative feedback, resulting in a system ready for use.

**Backend Status:** FastAPI is running, using MongoDB for data storage. Authentication is secured via JWT and simplified to use usernames (admin, cashier, inventory) suitable for POS staff. Key APIs (Auth, Dashboard Stats, Exhibition Management) are confirmed working.

**Frontend Status:** The application is built using React and Tailwind CSS, featuring the restored, elegant Hakimi branding (golden circular logo, amber/orange theme, Inter font). The complex application structure, including the Sidebar and multi-view routing (Dashboard, Products, Categories, POS, Expenses, etc.), has been successfully restored from the original source.

**Feature Status (Sample Data Loaded):**
1.  **Products/Categories:** Loaded with sample luxury goods data (Perfume Oils, Attar, Bakhoor) showing profitability and stock status.
2.  **Expense Manager:** Fully functional with easy-to-use quick amount buttons for daily expense logging related to exhibition operations (Travel, Salary).
3.  **POS System ():** Implemented with product searching, category filtering, cart management, and real-time total calculation including a 5% tax rate, displayed in AED.

The immediate task before this handover was triggered by the user asking for a final verification of the implemented POS logic against the previously accessed GitHub repository.

Access the original POS component from the GitHub repository to compare and ensure the current  implementation matches all intended logic.
